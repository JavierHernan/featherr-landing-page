        <p>It can be surprisigly difficult making friends in college.
      Featherr is a friend making app for college students.
      Think of Featherr as a location based, group, chat-roulette.
      No feeds with mindless scrolling, just get to know new people.</p>
            <p>Join small groups, called cliques, of other random people from your university.
      Invite friends to join a clique and chat with new people, together.
      Like the people in a clique? Save it. Don't care to get to know them more?
      Don't save it. Unsaved cliques are replaced with new ones to allow you to
      continue meeting new people.</p>

          Cliques are small groups of other students from your college who you can chat with.
          If you like the people in a clique and want to stay, you can save it.
          Unsaved cliques are replaced with new ones every XX hours. However, others
          who have not saved will be cycled away too.
      </div>
      <div id="aboutText2">
        So, it may be best to add your new friend who hasn't saved the clique
        to your friends list so that you don't lose contact.
        Invite friends from your friends list to meet new people, together. Neither of you
        will be cycled out if you entered together, but new people will be
        placed into your clique to carry on the conversation.
